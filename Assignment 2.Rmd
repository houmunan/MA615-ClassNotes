## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




1. Create the vectors: 
(a) (1,2,3,...,19,20) 
(b) (20,19,...,2,1) 
(c) (1,2,3,...,19,20,19,18,...,2,1) 
(d) (4,6,3) and assign it to the name tmp. 
For parts (e), (f) and (g) look at the help for the function rep. 
(e) (4,6,3, 4,6,3,...,4,6,3) where there are 10 occurrences of 4. 
(f) (4,6,3, 4,6,3,...,4,6,3,4) where there are 11 occurrences of 4, 10 occurrences of 6 and 10 occurrences of 3. 
(g) (4,4,...,4, 6,6,...,6, 3,3,...,3) where there are 10 occurrences of 4, 20 occurrences of 6 and 30 occurrences of 3.
